recruitMessage = "{Senua Black} (Level 9 Storm Clan) is now recruiting active Warframe players.  We welcome and encourage any and all MR, Play Styles, Frames, Builds, Ideas, etc. Message for invite."

rulesOne = "In order to keep an active and helpful Clan we do have a few guidelines\n\n#1:  After 14 days of inactivity in Warframe you will get a message asking if you wish to remain a member.  If you do not respond or if you have chosen to move on in life then you will be removed from Senua Black.  You are welcome to re-join at any time as long as we have room.\n\n#2:  We are a Clan that allows anyone and everyone.  If someone asks a question in #warframe that seems obvious or trivial to you, please refrain from any negative comments.  If someone is talking about something that you don't understand, interject and ask them to clarify.  Communication is vital for us to move forward together.\n\n"

rulesTwo = "#3:  Discordis can save information regarding your current status in Warframe.  This will let all of us know where we are in Warframe and what we are currently trying to achieve.  This makes for easier Squad creation by allowing you to find others who are doing similar things.  Use $HELP to display Discordis Bot Commands.\n\n#4:  New Members will be Initiates for 3 days.  You will then be promoted to Soldier.  After 1 Month if you have reached MR10 you will be considered for promotion(not guaranteed).  Once you reach MR14 you can request to become a General.  Warlords will be chosen."

titles = "Initiate:  Visit Dojo and create Blueprints.  Access #warframe, #fashionframe, #news, #information, #updates.\n\nSoldier:  Invite players to Clan.  Add decorations in Dojo.  Contibute resources.\n\nOfficer:  Access #senuafuture.  Add text/voice channels.  Kick members from chat channels in Discord and in Warframe.\n\nGeneral:  Kick/ban member from Discord and Clan.  Promote current members.  Access #leaders.\n\nWarlord:  Everything except delete Clan, delete Discord Server, demote Founding Warlord."

missionStatement = "Our goal is to recruit and retain active Warframe players who will join us in helping anyone and everyone with whatever the endeavor may be while also furthering our own achievments.\n \nSenua Black accepts anyone who wants to join.  We will all move forward together even if our personal goals are quite different.\n\nWe encourage high ranking players to lend assistance when asked.  If you are new to Warframe we want you to feel comfortable asking questions and engaging in conversations.\n \n Thanks so much for joining Senua Black!"

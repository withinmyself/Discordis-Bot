Invite Code is set to invite new members to the welcome/bot room.  The bot lays out a few rules and
how to utilize the bot.  Its not pre-written text.  The screen will be cleared and written out as needed
so new users don't have to scroll all the way up to the top to try and figure out what our rules are.  As 
the bot continues the new user will have to respond in order to join.

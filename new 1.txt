"Hey Kiddo.." 

Welcome to Senua Black's Discord Server. 
My name is E.T. Deubner.  In Warframe, I am withinmyself.  I am Warlord for Senua Black and Leader of the alliance All Are Welcome. 

Senua Black is growing every day.  My original members, The Ghosters, are always happy to help new members settle in comfortably. 

My 5 Generals are especially enthusiastic when it comes to offering a helping hand.  If I'm not available to help you get orientated please contact any one of them.

Senua Black Generals IGN:  BoxOfAwesome, PJtheBatman95, ChilledOcean, BiggzGaming and Happygilmore1 

We've all climbed this confusing and seemingly impossible game together so we know the hardships you'll face.  Please ask questions and get clarification regarding anything you're not 100% sure about.

We love answering questions about Warframe.  It makes us feel smart.  And if we don't know the answer then we will find it together and everyone will have learned something new. 

My top priority is to make every single member feel comfortable, welcome and useful.  Including myself! I can't wait for the opportunity to see this game from multiple points of view while I learn and grow right along with everyone else. 

If you're already knowledgeable in all things Warframe, I'd ask that you adopt these same attitudes towards new comers and also that you keep an open mind so that you too can learn and grow as we all move forward.(edited)

Quick Guidelines - Rules Wonderful Rules

BEHAVIOR THAT WILL GET YOU KICKED OUT
A. No activity /communication in 14 days
B. Aggressive verbal abuse
C. Cheating/Hacking or taking advantage of an exploit that could potentially harm the rest of the Clan
D. Complete refusal to participate in clan activities or at least random clan squads
E. An unforeseeable act or issue that is only solved by your removal*

*In other words, we have the right to kick anyone out for any reason at any time.   We do not want to do this.  It would take something quite extreme to go down this path.(edited)

!! NOW WHAT!!

Go to the Channel called #warframe-ign   Type in your in-game-name for Warframe and hit enter.  Then send a Ghoster or Myself a message saying you're ready to be promoted to Shadow. 

Depending on the time of day, it could take over an hour before we respond.  In most cases it'll be instant. We will then promote you in Discord and in Warframe.

!!THEN WHAT?? 

Like everything else in this game DE doesn't make joining a Clan straight forward.  You'll now have to build a Dojo key using your foundry.  You should already have the Blueprint.  It takes 12 hours or 10 plat to rush.  I suggest not wasting your plat but it's up to you.

!! AND?? 

Come see us in #warframe or in clan chat in Warframe.  We'll see what's going on that day and let you know what you can do next.

Welcome to Senua Black my friend!   You will not regret joining a clan.  We try to make it as painless as possible these first few days.  I can't wait to fight along side with you in this beautifully neurotic tragedy we call Warframe.
